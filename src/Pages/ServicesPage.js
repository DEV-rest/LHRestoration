    { name: "Leonora Spong", feedback: "We are in New Bern, NC which was devastated by Hurricane Florence. We chose Longhorn Restoration to handle the remediation on our and our neighbors flooded garages. As soon as we met Adam we had a sense of relief due to his competency and confidence he could alleviate our growing mold problem. His estimate was much more reasonable than that of another contractor who we felt was trying to take advantage of our situation. He explained the steps that he would take and the length of time involved which we never got from the other contractor. Over the length of time it took to resolve our problem we feel we made a friend in Texas! We are very pleased with his professionalism and work ethic and would gladly recommend his services. During this horrendous event it can be overwhelming and it is a great relief to find a company as honest and capable as Longhorn Restoration.", image: "image2.jpg" },
    { name: "Chandra Buck Manzke", feedback: "I highly recommend Longhorn Restoration. They saved my beautiful gray and cream rug after our dog got very ill. They picked the rug up at our house the day I called, had it back in less than a week and it was very affordable. On top of that, Adam was very friendly. Thank you for the outstanding job!", image: "image3.jpg" },
